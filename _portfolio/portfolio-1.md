This section showcases research practices and translational outcomes across three core technical domains, using data-driven approaches to address challenges in public health and preventive medicine. It integrates bioinformatics to unravel molecular associations between pathogens and hosts, employs niche modelling to predict disease transmission and species distribution patterns, and leverages meta-analysis to synthesize global evidence for informed decision-making.  

Featured here are representative projects from my research and practical work: from mining and annotating metagenomic data of tick pathogens to simulating spatiotemporal distributions of infectious diseases via niche models; from statistical analyses of individual studies to systematic integration and bias control of multi-center evidence. Each case comprehensively presents technical workflows, key methodological details (e.g., R/Python implementations, model parameter optimization, data visualization logic), and tangible outputs (e.g., predictive maps, decision-making recommendations, technical scripts). These works reflect both innovative ideas at the intersection of interdisciplinary technologies and a core focus on "technology serving public health practice."  

Exploring these projects offers insight into how I apply bioinformatics, ecological modelling, and evidence-based analysis tools to solve practical issues such as pathogen surveillance, disease risk assessment, and public health intervention. Discussions on technical details and potential collaborations are welcome.

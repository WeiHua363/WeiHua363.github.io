I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Health Data Science at the [National Institute of Health Data Science](https://sph.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Fuqiang Cui](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=Ei2xHGoAAAAJ). My research interests include AI for ECG (AI-ECG), medical time-series data, and digital health tools.

You can find my CV here: [XX's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).

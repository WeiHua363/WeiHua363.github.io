I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the [School of Public Health](https://sph.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Fuqiang Cui](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=Ei2xHGoAAAAJ). My research interests include epidemiology and prevention and control strategies for infectious diseases, immunization strategy for vaccine-preventable diseases, and immunological intervention strategies.
